create a workspace : 
copy the workspace id in order to use it on colab 
create an access token : 
access the workspace 
click on finetuning -> create new fine tuning -> select the desired model 
In gradient we have to use a specific format for the inputs : see documentation for more resources : 
https://docs.gradient.ai/docs/tips-and-tricks

to see the created model : 
go to gradient.ai 
go to the workspace -> models and you will find your model if it was created 

test the model on the gradient ai platform : 
go to gradient.ai 
go to the workspace -> models -> select the model and click on test -> give him prompts you want to test
